# Mitch Video Script Generator

Generate video scripts that sound like Mitch using proven frameworks from successful videos.

---

## How It Works

**The Formula:**

```
Framework Transcripts (structure from great videos)
+ Mitch Voice Samples (how Mitch actually talks)
+ Your Video Idea
= Script that sounds like Mitch but follows proven patterns
```

---

## Setup (Do Once)

### 1. Add Framework Transcripts

- Find 3-5 videos with strong structure you admire
- Get their transcripts (YouTube auto-captions work)
- Save in `framework_transcripts/` folder
- Use the template provided
- Name: `framework_[creator]_[topic].md`

**Good sources**: Educational YouTubers, business content, philosophy channels

### 2. Add Mitch Voice Samples

- Record Mitch explaining concepts naturally
- Transcribe (rough is fine)
- Save in `mitch_voice_samples/` folder
- Use the template provided
- Name: `mitch_voice_[topic]_[date].md`

**Best captures**: Casual explanations, rants, off-the-cuff takes

## Generate Scripts (Weekly)

### Step 1: Open the Generator

Open `SCRIPT_GENERATOR_PROMPT.md` and copy the full prompt

### Step 2: Fill It In

- Add 2-3 framework transcripts
- Add 2-3 Mitch voice samples
- Add your video idea (hook, message, key points)

### Step 3: Generate

Paste into Cursor/Claude → get your script in 1 minute

### Step 4: Tweak (Critical!)

- Read aloud - does it sound like Mitch?
- Sharpen the hook - is it scroll-stopping?
- Cut 20-30% - remove all fluff
- Strengthen takeaway - is it actionable?

### Step 5: Save

Save final version in `generated_scripts/`

**Time**: 15-20 min per script (vs 1-2 hours writing from scratch)

## Quality Checklist

Before calling a script "done":

✅ Hook stops the scroll  
✅ Sounds like Mitch talking  
✅ Clear structure  
✅ Natural tech metaphors  
✅ Actionable takeaway  
✅ Under target length  
✅ Zero fluff

## Pro Tips

1. **Generate 2-3 versions** - cherry-pick best parts
2. **Read aloud** - if it doesn't sound natural, it won't work
3. **Cut ruthlessly** - first drafts are always too long
4. **Match energy** - high-energy video needs high-energy voice samples
5. **Update library** - add new voice samples monthly

## Remember

**AI gets you 80%, you finish it.**

- Frameworks = structure
- Voice samples = authenticity
- AI = speed
- Your tweaking = greatness

Generate 5 scripts in the time it used to take to write 1.
