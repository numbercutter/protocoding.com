## The Script

**The Real Pill:** "If you don't act on an idea within 72 hours, your brain kills it automatically."

**Hook (0-5s):**
"You know why most of your ideas die? It's not because they're bad. It's because you're running on biological firmware that auto-deletes anything you don't execute within 72 hours."

**Body (5-25s):**
"Here's what happens: You get hit with inspiration. Dopamine spikes. Your brain lights up. But if you don't take action within three days, your nervous system reads it as 'false alarm' and starts pruning that neural pathway. It's like your brain's garbage collection - if you don't commit the idea to memory through action, it gets marked for deletion.

This isn't motivation advice. This is how your hardware works. Ideas aren't meant to be stored. They're meant to be executed."

**Takeaway (25-30s):**
"So the rule is simple: 72 hours. That's your window. Take one action - doesn't have to be big - just prove to your nervous system that this idea matters. Otherwise, you're just daydreaming with extra steps."

## Visual Notes

- Text overlay at 0:03: "72 HOURS"
- Show brain/neural pathway visual when explaining pruning
- Fast cuts between 5-15s to match energy
- Slow down slightly for the takeaway (25-30s)
- End with "72 HOURS" text again

---

## Tone Notes

- Start with slight edge/provocation (hook)
- Shift to educational/explanatory (body)
- End with direct, actionable (takeaway)
- Overall energy: Medium-high, conversational but intense
- Pacing: Quick but not rushed, let key phrases land
