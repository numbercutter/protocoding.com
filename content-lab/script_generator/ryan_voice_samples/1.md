what's up everyone so this is a video that just popped on my feed that kind of shocked me the title of this video is I quit my software engineering job plus here's why it's by a channel CIA park and why this is shocking to me is all I hear and see nowadays is people dying for a job everyone wants a job and all this so I'm wondering why did this person quit their software engineering job let's find out job as a developer I know that I might have like it in the videos that I had said in the past and yes officially my first day as a non-employed person uh was officially yesterday and yesterday I just had a really nice time just being at home uh yeah if you have burnout from software engineering I'm telling you that first day when you don't have to go in feels like heaven so I feel her really not doing anything just to kind of EXP explain who I am I have been working as a software developer for the last 3 years as an international student and if any of you guys know International students are only given one year of opt stem students are given two extra years yep oh yeah I've talked about that multiple times that uh that stem student uh Visa there very nice three years to work I was given three years to work and during that time time I got laid off once and this was my actual first time quitting a job software jobs are in high demand yes I heard that and that's why I also started it and I also know that there are less jobs now than those looking for the software jobs it's way too saturated and there are people laid off from meta from all these other big tech companies who are fighting for this one Junior role I want to explain the competition for a junior role at a Fang company is probably unbelievable I I used to say that at a job I used to work at we would get 10,000 applicants in one hour and again this is a high level staff job but for a junior level at a well-known company a fan company I can only imagine how much competition there is for that single Junior role the reason why I wanted to take a break break from software development and try to tread the waters again first of all it's not wise to start anything just because someone says it is good y you need to find your passion you need to know that it is the right thing for you for me there were so many red flags when I was studying CSN College I was never actually curious about the fundamentals of computer science during the four years I kept uh doubting myself and I just had the hardest time um just prepping for tests studying doing homework and I should have realized that I did not like CS back then but I thought everyone else had a hard time it was true everyone yeah you know the uh how much everyone says you're going to make how much jobs are out there for software Engineers it it makes you overlook all these things that are red flags it's crazy everyone was having a hard time but it was at least stuff that they were getting but for me uh most of the times I was like I don't understand this but I just went along with it I feel like that was a red flag for me even now I can say for sure like I don't want to be in the Cs for 10 20 years even still it is a computer desk job it's most of the times it's not too stressful on the body um minus those people working at startups but yeah all of these B basically lured me on and I was never able to really sit down and ask myself what do I like and for the longest time I think that I just wanted to be rich yesterday as I as I was just thinking about it I had no goal in life which was why I just wanted to be a rich person I didn't know what I wanted so I knew that having the money would slowly but surely get me to the path that I wanted but there's so many people that are like this all they want to do is find a career that pays the most money that's all they care about really if you do that you're not going to win out in any software engineering position you might be able to get some jobs but you're not going to get to the top level the people that really are the top tier software Engineers are passionate about learning they understand they love understanding all the different concepts about everything within software engineering so that's who you're competing with and to them they're more passion about working on the project than actually getting paid to beat out someone with that mindset is extremely difficult unless you're gifted um but if you're gifted why are you in software engineering do something else and make tons of money because you wouldn't have to deal with all these other people who are actually passionate about the technology but if I don't seek the path I don't think I'm ever going to get there I know a lot of people who are in college are taking CS for its job satisfaction or for its um High status or or or the visa to come over here or to go work in the Silicon Valley and I'm not saying that there's nothing wrong with it I'm just saying that it might not be all that it might not be all glamorous and a luxury um there are so many other jobs there are so many roles in this world that I never even thought about I wish everyone could just kind of take a chance and see what it is that they actually like do you really like just dabbing at the code all day or are you a more interactive person that likes to talk to people that um loves relationships or are you someone that loves to design do you like uh presenting or um do you like collaborating so just with this broad world that we're in and if you haven't thought about it yet and if you are laid off and if you're having a hard time try to take a step back and see what this time is actually telling you it took me a while you know I going to say this it's a little controversial but the reality is if you're a cute girl why are you in software engineering unless you absolutely love it and clearly this uh CIA Park here did not love it do something else there's so many other things you could do if you are someone like her there's so many other roles you know you don't want to be behind a death staring at code you can't utilize some of your best skills may it be communication may it be things like that you are really just bound to what you deliver and looking at a screen there's not really much beyond that there's not a lot of social things and things like that that a person like this especially if she's making YouTube videos and able to talk like this so well can really benefit from software engineering doesn't really give you that those benefits what it really is looking for is your ability to understand and deliver code to really decide to give up my job because uh a decent amount of salary and if I were to quit a job I was that amount of money lacking in my life you know what there might not be a time in the future where I can be this comfortable where I can actually even have the decision to quit and uh maybe test the waters for a little while in the end yes I might go back to CS but I also might be able to find a path that I have never ever ever thought about before if any of you guys are laid off and are watching this try to take a step back and think it actually might be a blessing in disguise it seems like companies were hiring a lot but things are slowly but surely changing um if you still like the tech Workforce maybe go start working at a smaller company where um the software roles are an actual pivotal role in the company and the company can't run without it if you I absolutely agree if you want a social life don't work at a big Tech firm a lot of the time you will not have a social life because everyone's too busy staring at their screen startups have some of the best culture there and even starts I've worked on that I didn't enjoy per se engineer like writing code for them and understand the application and working with people the social aspect there was still Leaps and Bounds better than a lot of other larger tech companies that I've worked with with because again they're they're more you know you still have that you they're focused on understanding who you are more than at those large companies you probably are just a number unfortunately you go into a huge company well depending on the department you might be a necessary resource and sometimes you might be an experiment so if you want job security you can maybe go seek smaller opportunities if you still like more being on the for Forefront of Technology then do lead code hard enough ask for referrals do coffee chants I find that in this type of a world we're in right now ultimately it's the people who make the decisions AI is for sure maybe going to see all the resumés and select out which ones but ultimately it's actually the people relationships and it's knowing that you'll fit in that will get you the job do a lot of research in who's really at your company uh that you want to work in and look through all their connections try to see if there's someone that you can relate to and ask them questions ask them if they'll be available for a little minute or two for 5 minutes to ask them for a question about a role at their company and great advice here this type of networking does wonders explain who you are find Common Grounds explain what you're having trouble with and it's not just merely you know oh I was laid off I need to find a new job or I'm a new grad I want to find a new job but really find the passion in the mission that they're trying to solve in um in the vision that the entire company is trying to own for themselves I still haven't figured out cuz it's been a day but it is my wish to really just help navigate 20s 30 year olds um to search for a meaning in their life to not just waste time earning the money because you can earn money so many years in the future you're telling me looking at zeros and ones all day isn't meaningful that doesn't derive happiness I don't know and if your life doesn't depend on the job maybe try to seek what it is that you really like every single thing that happens in your life is a puzzle piece of yourself it's a piece that's going to be a Remnant and it's going to affect who you are in the future so really take every time every single step take it and let it sink in and and find out your next PATH right now I don't miss the money you know I will say this she sounds like she's spiritual she sounds like she wants to help others there's way more money in that if you're actually a good speaker and you become kind of the top of that industry and someone like this could probably be good at that so if really you want money I don't understand why you would ever even consider going back to CS I I would guarantee if she had any other job that she liked more for example if she was like a guru helping advising people on how to find meeting in their life or whatever and she was making money even if it wasn't more than a fake company why would you go back you know why it just that's it if you're just in for the money and you hate it you can only stay in it for so long I feel like I have a lot of time I love seeing the sunlight just kind of seeping in into the window cuz I never uh saw the sunlight for 2 years while I was working I love my life right now I that's a that's a damn shame I was a little scared because my manager kept telling me since the point that I put my two weeks in that I was a little foolish for you know trying to quit at this time in my life with no job lined up but I just thought it was the right thing to do and I can't say I don't have any regrets because at that time I was like maybe he's right maybe I'm just foolish you know maybe I'm not thinking about myself for the future but right now I can just say that I'm a happier person than I was a week ago and I hope that in a year when someone asks me are you happy with your life I can say yes without a doubt if I can say yes I don't think this decision of quitting my job would be a regretful one I'm already happy with the decision made and so I hope a lot of you can also take a step of bravery and maybe seek out a new thing that um is not accustomed to your life habits right now uh yeah you know that's a good point I know a lot of people you know similar to software engineering a lot of people especially starting off in college what they all do is they want to be pre-med they all want to be doctors and it's okay you know if you look at them you know I know people that have tried to become doctors wasted all this time hard work Miss so many social events miss you know hanging out with so many friends and meeting so many new friends to be a doctor just to ultimately find out that this wasn't for them and once they found that and they shifted careers their life just got so much better for them they had so much more enjoyment in life so again you need a way the enjoyment with the money and it takes a real it takes a real crazy SOB to just grind money and absolutely hate what they're doing because there's only so long you could do that for uh change is good and change makes you grow so Embrace that change and think why that change has come to you why at this point why out of billion people in this world why this event might have happened to you during this sabatical month slash year or how long this is going to last I actually have three goals the first one is to kind of seek out my career path maybe if I want to go in business I kind of wanted to learn how maybe a Cafe's business model looks like so I've been thinking about let's see if any of these kind of paths are continuing uh learning Cs and becoming a better developer well maybe I should work at a cafe as a b sta to go back to school and do maybe nursing or maybe seek like a healthc care degree so I've been looking into prere requirements like that so that's kind of my first goal um search for various career outcomes because I never had the chance to and second uh workout working out working out and just kind of building that St cuz muscles whenever I stop it just disappears and I'm at that low Peak I'm at the lowest Peak right now so and you even lift bro I want to be able to really lift some weights be healthy and just love my body uh third is language this week I found a study that basically says when you learn a second language or when you're um having a conversation in your second language then you you basically use your dang I thought you was going to say a programming language there for a second brain nerves to its maximum potential so when you're like thinking oh hey what was that word in English what was that word in Korean in Chinese that's when your nerve system is like going crazy going wild it's basically stimulating your brain nerves so that they don't age we live a comfortable life we live a very all right that's about that's about all I need to see for this video um you just get out of software engineering it doesn't look like you want to be in it or if you made any money elsewhere you would go back so you made the right decision go live a great life doing whatever else makes you happy I'm sure you'll find it I'm sure you'll do great doing it that's it for this video guys we are sponsored by protoc coding.com now protoc coding is a software consultancy firm that I've run um if

zero to MVP and Beyond please reach out to us at protoc coding.com for a free estimate we'll be happy to provide that for you all right everyone that's it for this video take care
What's up, y'all? So, in today's video, I'm going to go over how to run a successful software consulting company. Now, over the past year, I've been running protocoding full-time, and there's a lot of dos and don'ts I've learned about working within the software consulting space, and I want to share with you guys in this video so you can run your own successful software consulting company. Let's get on into it. So, my first point here is take Adderall. Make sure you're taking a 30 XR every day. This will effectively 2x your engineering bandwidth and you don't have to eat. I'm totally just kidding. Do not do that. My first actual point here is make sure you have a long-term reliable and stable client. And notice I didn't say clients there. Having multiple clients like this is a luxury and it's not always needed to get started. Ask anyone, they will tell you they'll rather have one long-term stable, reliable client than multiple unreliable and unstable clients. So, make sure that you have this client and better yet, make sure that you are doing great work for them consistently. And this contract, let's touch on the contract real quick. Doesn't need to be a home run contract here. This is really something to just get you revenue coming in. And once you have this signed, make sure you're doing consistent great work for them. Through this, you could start that snowball effect because people will get, you know, people will have word of mouth and people will know more about your company through the great work you're doing at this other company. And that will start that snowball and you'll start accumulating more clients and you'll start building up your clientele list. But really, you need one big client. I can't tell you how many consulting shops out there just serve one client. Think how many consulting shops just serve Amazon or just serve Walmart or just serve uh Microsoft. The one big consistent client is huge here. Make sure you have it. Make sure you're doing great work. It's a great starting point to get your snowball rolling. Now, next up here is the team. Make sure that whoever you're hiring to work for you is reliable, trustworthy, highly skilled, and presentable. Yes, presentable. I know a lot of you probably don't think that last one matters, but let me tell you this. A lot of the time, especially if you're a smaller consulting shop, client meetings happen. And sometimes you need to bring on the software engineer that's working on these client meetings. And if they're not presentable, if they're not someone that is, I mean, if this person is introverted, if this person is unkempt, it's a direct reflection of you. It's a direct reflection of your company. And is this how you want to present your company? Obviously not. So, you want to make sure that they are presentable. You want to make sure that they are highly skilled. I can't tell you how many times I've had to hire engineers and let them go because they weren't skilled enough. They were wasting too many hours. They were wasting too many hours understanding what was going on instead of actually writing code and delivering software. It is a skill gap that cost you big. Now, another thing here is the best pay structure I found here is hourly because it really does well for engineers if they want to put in the hours. It's a win-winwin. They get paid for as many hours that they could work in a month. And again, sometimes engineers for us could do a 100 hours, get paid for 100 hours of work. Um, we have that incentive out so they deliver great work and they deliver it on time or even exceeding expectations, delivering it early. We are happy with the software being delivered and the quality of it. And the client is ecstatic about getting highquality software delivered them in a timely manner. So, it's a win-winwin. I mean, at this point, we're cutting five figure paychecks to people monthly, and this is what you need. And you need to make sure your margins are right to support this because really, keeping your teammates, your employees happy and paid and with tons of work is how you keep growing, how you keep surviving, how you get that next client in. And again, if you're not growing like this, you're dying in this industry. Now, next up here, what I want to talk about is making sure to let people go when it's time to let people go. And again, in this industry, making money, having cash flow, and is everything. VC firms are looking for a 500x, you know, close. That's how much they're looking to make out when the company closes. And most software consulting companies maybe at most have a 4x multiplier on their value. No real investor is going to put big money into a software consulting shop. So really it's service based and you need to bring in money here if you're hiring on engineers or anyone in any capacity, managers, whatever, if they are losing your money, excuse me, if they are losing you money, if they're not providing excellent value, if they're not propelling the team forward and the company forward, you need to let them go. It's unfortunate because I really think that every employee, especially at smaller companies, you become friends with them. You really do. And all the cremagins I know are going to say, "You can't become friends with your employees. What if you have to let them go? It's going to be so hard. It's the price of doing business." And it's unfortunate. And really, you failed by bringing them on. You need to take ultimate ownership here that it was your fault bringing them on and it's your fault that they're not up to snuff and not up to making you money. So really, the only one to blame here is you. So instead of worrying about them, you need to worry about the company and you need to worry about yourself because you're the one that brings people on the team. You need to make sure that whoever you're bringing on the team is adding value and bringing in money because if this is not happening, you go under. You really do. Now, another quick point I want to touch on here is networking. So networking is huge. If you live in a big tech city, great. You need to be going to a networking event every week if possible, at least two a month. And I would say that take the money and spend it to go to even more luxurious, you know, high ticket events in the area. South by Southwest, Tech Weeks in uh New York, Tech Weeks in San Francisco. Make sure you're around where the money is, where the investment is. And if you live in a city that doesn't have this big tech scene, guess what? You're going to have to travel because really putting money into marketing, budgeting, all this stuff, it just does not drive clients in. It's not like you're selling a candy bar, something that people could buy insignificantly. You're selling high quality software and that demands thousands of dollars to be built. And that's not something that people will see an ad and say, "Okay, I'm gonna have this software consulting company work for me." That almost never happens. It's very unlikely to happen. So, your best bet here is again that word of mouth I talked about earlier and networking. And the best way to network is to be at these events where these people are. Who do you want to look for at these events? What events do you want to go to? Well, you want to go to events that have a lot of these type of people. And this is who we usually target is older older businessmen or women that have a lot of money looking to invest and they're very techsavvy or they're disruptors. They're trying to disrupt a whole industry. These are the people you need to be around. You need to be in contact with them because these are going to be your best friends within the industry. They are some of the best clients to work for because they understand um the vision. They want to build cool software. So again, another thing is, you know, you get your engineers a lot of hours, but what's best is if you get your engineers a lot of hours that build their skill set, that teach them all these different skills that they didn't have, you know, they wouldn't have been exposed to or have had to have worked on um in personal project. These are things that could be taught professionally. So having high quality engineering hours given to your employees is huge. It boosts morale. It keeps people interesting and again gets stuff done effectively, excuse me, efficiently and on a timely matter. So make sure that that is in place there. Now I also want to talk about contracts. Contracts are really something that defines your business. Having a good contract could really make or break a client for you. I talked earlier about having smaller contracts out there and I wouldn't really recommend that you take on too many small ticket clients. For every small ticket client I've worked for, only a few have really been profitable. A lot of them I either broke even or lost money, but more often than not, I lost money due to how many additional hours we had to spend. Smaller clients, they usually are the ones that have more feedback, want things done in certain ways, have all these stipulations that you have to follow. Maybe they're not paying on time either. You know, you have to wait net 45 to collect. There's all these different things that could happen with small ticket clients, and I would avoid them if you can. Don't undervalue yourself. Find where to position yourself best for an hour, but you don't want to go too low and you don't want to take two small ticket items because this is something that will really affect your lifestyle. You will be spending a lot of time doing a lot of work and maybe at best you're breaking even. Okay, so talking about all that there, let's circle back to networking. Make sure you go to these events. Make sure you're there and make sure you follow up. Make sure you have business cards ready. Make sure you follow up. Following up is key here. This is probably the best way to bring in new business or get new relationships out there is to follow up. Too many times people do not follow up after you have great meetings or whatever. Anyone you have out there, make sure you're always following up and checking in on them. at networking events with past clients with people you may have given estimates to and haven't signed on anything. Make sure you follow up with them. And finally, I'll leave you with this. Just do the right thing really goes a long way. Make sure you're paying people on time. Make sure you're delivering great software. Doing the right thing. There's always corners to cut. There's always ways to get around. Get cheap labor. Deliver the bare minimum when the code is complete spaghetti. There's all these ways to get around it, but from what I found, doing the right thing, building great software, getting these things out, this is what is best within the industry. I know it doesn't get you that kind of short-term satisfaction of getting things out, making more margins in the low in the short term, but really, you got to treat it like a long-term game. You need to build up your team. You need to make sure you have things in place. You need to just keep going here because the more you go, the more time you spend, the more successful your software engineering company will be. All right, and that's it, guys. Let me know what you think in the comments about running your own software consulting shop. Have you thought about running your own software consulting shop? Let me know if you have any questions. I'll talk to you guys later. Take her.
