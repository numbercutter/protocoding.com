what's up everyone it's another sunny day out here in Austin check out this view just gorgeous Skyline see a lot of cranes going up there a lot of activity happening in this city so in today's video what I want to talk about is the real thing you should be worried about in software engineering now the hype is all about AI now ai is going to replace your job AI could basically eliminate all junior level position jobs all this fear mongering and overhype of AI but really from what I found what we should all be more worried about is outsourcing as a business owner I've been going to a lot of tech meetups lately and at all these Tech meetups I will see people there doing some type of nearshoring or offshoring reach out where they represent software Engineers that work either in Mexico Nearshore Argentina Peru or they work offshore you know India Pakistan and even Africa Ethiopia actually there was someone who was representative from an Ethiopian software consultancy agency and their pitch is enticing they work for fractions of what you would pay a software engineer here um what was kind of shocking is I was talking with someone that represented a software consultancy agency in Ethiopia we were chatting talking they were telling me about the team how they set up how many Engineers you could have on the team and I basically asked them you know what's the cost and after just some kind of going back and forth she basically told me it's a minimum wage so essentially $7 I think it might be 725 or 750 in Texas but really that is all you need to pay to have a senior level software engineer come and join your team I mean that's unbelievable obviously there's issues with it like I said before the communication with a team like that is terrible um they work really off hours so you do have to stay up late or get up early to uh sync with them but what they do is you know they provide you with someone that kind of manages the team that works your hours and is a good English Communicator so as a business owner I just think that this offer is so enticing and a lot of people that run these companies what they're going to do is just do that they're just going going to have everyone be offshore I I remember I worked at a startup once that had a massive part of their application built by a team in Pakistan I can only imagine what they were paying that team in Pakistan but check this out guys let me get up here the view of the city Skyland is insane right there that sales ship building that is uh that is the new Google office here in Austin fun fact about that a lot of these tech companies when they're in different cities besides Silicon Valley there's not a lot of really exciting teams out here I wonder what type of teams are out here but usually you know teams are doing YouTube things are doing some stuff exciting and Google they're all based in that uh Silicon Valley area all right so back to this so yes lot of near Shoring where they work the same hours a lot of offshoring where it's even cheaper but they work different hours obviously with these teams you're going to have communications issues but it really makes it that much harder for software Engineers here to get a job knowing that at the drop of a hat a business own could just replace everyone for a fraction of the cost and with the help of AI they probably can really stick in the game here now if you think that's bad I heard something even crazier there's a couple companies um I kind of learned through Contracting but what they do is they are in they essenti have indentured servants working for them and they're computer scientists and maybe they have debts family debts they need to payoff so we're talking even less than minimum wage that you're paying for these people to come and help you build your application it's unbelievable you know it's unethical it's crazy but in this world of hyper capitalism it's it's kind of you know you try to get every Advantage you can and obviously as a software Consulting agency your biggest cost is is your software Engineers it makes you think wow let's just do this build the application for as cheap as possible then try to get out there and sell it or let's build other people's applications for as cheap as possible and charge them you know be extremely competitive with the rate but honestly it just doesn't feel right it's just not ethical that's why I probably I'm never going to do that honestly not even probably I'm never going to really do that it kind of feels like you're selling out and so what it costs more so what all these things happen you know what they can't replace is team Synergy they can't replace team camaraderie and they can't replace communication and that's what's most important I remember working with some offshore team and their application was so badly built it was almost unreadable it really was so hard to understand what the code was doing and everything was importing everything and they were using libraries that you know they were you know libraries that no one knew what they were importing and there was all these issues and stuff I mean it was quite quite the clunky application and that's where a lot of things are going to happen the bar for terrible software is going to go higher and higher and higher I mean you see in the video game industry you see all these software comes out there are terrible everyone accepts that now within the software industry you're going to see that everything is terrible and people accept it I mean my iPhone for example I went from the 12 to a 16 and the 16 performs worse than my 12 it it crashes all the time and there's so much lag and it's just you accept it that's what it is the bar is low and I feel with people kind of going over putting all this work overseas it's going to happen now my final thoughts on this are you already see this kind of happening you know a lot of the time when these large companies excuse me when they hire you know I you could say Indian or just Pakistani or Eastern European CTO really I think a lot of their job is to start Outsourcing I mean if you look at American Airlines in Dallas there's a lot of there's a lot of worry and I believe this is going to happen they're going to Offshore their whole software engineering team everyone's going to be offshore and they do have a new person as a CTO that came in there and did that and you see us at a lot of other companies when the CTO or whoever is in charge when they are when they're usually from India Pakistan or any other these countries a lot of their role is to kind of Outsource and this to me is such a bigger concern than AI is in the near term and yeah I mean let me know what you think we could do about it it's just something insane to think about that people will work for such less and how people could pretty much work for nothing let me know what you think about this in the comments everyone take care
