Yeah, it's real. I had a dream about a flying spider last night. What's the deal with that?

Your consciousness behaves like a wave. It has peaks, it has valleys, it has a middle point. It's an oscillation

as creators. As conscious beings as God-like translations of the universe, it's our job to decipher this chaotic extreme nature and like a prism converted into beautiful, controlled expression.

The way to do this optimally is to find your midpoint, find the frequency that you can resonate at. That is a, a steady flow of consciousness that lives between the peaks in the valleys. This is where your true self lived. This is where the most

articulated expression of the universe resides.

Most people only know two states. They only live within these two maxed out parts of their consciousness. This wave form the highs and the lows, pushing themselves way too hard or taking it way too easy. I'm talking about finding a zone of consistent, of consistent, steady flow growth, controlled power anchored within a.

Within a good mood, within a,

a breath, within a relaxed, positive state

it's a level where your outcome detached. You're not hyper analyzing the past.

You're moving with authority over your aura.

You're being authentic.

There's nothing more magnetic than someone who's being authentic.

Your life is built. You're an architect for your reality,

If you can fine tune your internal world. And live within the midpoint of your wave, your frequency of consciousness, then you get the most authentic expression of what you truly desire.

This is simply a mental practice. It's a new way to think about your consciousness relative to physics

and it's an easy way to visualize how your consciousness operates it's a wave.

If you can recognize these patterns within your behavior by observing. The way that you're thinking and the way that you're moving, you can fine tune your resonance. You can fine tune where your default state of being is
