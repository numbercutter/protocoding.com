People just, they get a kick out of the negative aspects of human nature. They like to feel like they got punched in the gut. They also, I mean, don't get me wrong, they like to feel extremely high. That's why people are seeking different types of pleasure. Ones that might not have the greatest reward at the end of them.

Instant pleasure, cheap thrills, things that require zero physical or intellectual effort, but. Offer the most. The greatest temporary emotional feeling, emotional landscape existence within their body. That feels amazing, but they did nothing for it. Is this how you want to train your operating system? Is this the pattern that you want to feed into your.

Consciousness, your pattern recognition framework. Is this what you want to consistently generate within your reality? Instant gratification for no effort.

What kind of reality does that create for you if you're not being an adverse presence against the negative aspects of your human nature?

Do you want to generate more beautiful, cool shit within your interface? Things that you can feel proud of, things that took effort and work and love and creativity?

Is that what you want your reality interface to be composed out of? What is your source material? What type of fabrics and textures do you want to populate your reality screen? Is it something that someone else in your external reality fabricated? Something that might lean into the negative textures of reality?

Something that might be dark, devious, expressing a idea. An idea that is born out of the negative nature of humans, or do you want to focus on things that are more of your own desire, of your own craftsmanship, of your own intention, things that you've envisioned to.

I say the same thing every video, you are what you eat. The reality that exists within your screen is entirely dependent on your ability to control what you're consuming.

Is, are you currently living the life that you wanna live? Is your reality screen showing you everything that you want? Are you able to navigate the uncontrollable landscape with a positive attitude? It's not knocking you off, it's not crushing your emotional state. You're not really sad. Oh my God, this thing happened to me.

Why? Why is this happening to me?

You're moving with intention and when things come in the way you're able to navigate it and just simply remove it from your interface, life is messy. It's filled with mistakes. Ones that you made and ones that these characters within your interface are making. That's what makes it fun. What do you want?

A utopia, if there was no wavelength of existence that provided chaos for us to translate with our human prisms. We are creators. We are builders of worlds. We have so much power that's untapped because we're absorbing bullshit,

and it's because of our own

self-interest, our own tendencies towards instant gratification. And being too welcoming to these negative pleasure seeking states of the human endeavor. It's like free will.

Which one are you gonna choose?

Intention or non intention?

I would argue that non intention is non-existence.

If you're a bot, if you're a fucking

unintentional expression of reality, then what's the point? You might as well be dead.

I don't mean that literally like go die, but like.

We need more people to build and see the world through a lens of creation. We are creators.
