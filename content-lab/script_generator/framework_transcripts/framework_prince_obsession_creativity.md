one of the biggest lessons that I learned from Prince is that obsession is not a dirty word obsession is actually an artist's best friend all Obsession really means is Passion at the exclusion of everything else and the only people who won't like you using this word are the ones that are afraid that the exclusion of everything else part includes even them the only time obsession is unhealthy is when it's directed at things that don't serve you like when you're obsessed with your phone or when you're obsessed with someone you've never even talk to but being obsessed about creating art can only be a benefit to your soul and to the world around you every morning it's good to take one idea with you out into the world when you do that all your actions become more focused you see the entire world through a new filter instead of the ones that you usually default to you know like the filters of preconceived notions or of learned beliefs by leaving the house with a temporary artistic filter of your own choosing you see things you didn't see before even though these are the same streets as yesterday everything looks [Music] different case I watch this mortici on YouTube I've never experienced something like this I cannot sing right now just a little bit okay [Music] all of my favorite artists have one thing in common they all Embrace Randomness as part of the creative process that's why approaching strangers is such a great practice you never know what people are going to say will they be mean will they reject you or are you just about to meet your new best friend why do you draw I don't know it's just something I've done since I was a little kid and it was just like a like a coping mechanism for me as of like kind of travel through life to become an artist for the rest of your life is something that's like a large commitment and if you don't like have it it's it's kind of really really hard to pay the bills I feel like if I have to manufacture the creative process and like force it um I would just not enjoy it as much but this is like a drawing I did of the Virgin Mary I wanted to play with the imagery of Mary and her like Immaculate Heart and then later I did another iteration when I had like another similar dream and then that's this one right here yeah yeah talk to someone long enough and they'll eventually reveal what they really care about show me today's outfit this is the the shirt I've thrifted this ties like a leather pie I actually got from like a sex store this blazer from my mom three belts I think three belt breaks are more interesting visually there's some shortage there the skirt I also thrifted that's rings I have like a little dish of rings that I just grab before leaving the house I take a lot of influence from like alternative fashion um hard Juku fashion I was really into I uh grew up on like the my come K it's like wishing to God I had been like a teenager in the 2000s um so like I was really influenced by like um Hot Topic and like alternative emo clothing it doesn't really matter that much what you're wearing as long as the silhouette looks really good it doesn't really matter what you wear as long as a silhouette looks really good you do have an androgynous Vibe thank you so much I really appreciate that's exactly what I'm going for photography tip number 10 ignore celebrities create new ones this is a really cool tie though look at that and actually I think I am going to get this tie this is amazing yeah so 57 I [Applause] are you creative yes how are you creative um I take photos I make music I'm in welding school learning to use metal that's a form of creativity um I like to be creative with my makeup and I like to be creative with my outfits if my 8-year-old self today saw me how I look she would be so proud so the first one you'll get more of a delicate broth all right so very very sensitive infusion first one we're going to try here you get that one too many artists only want to talk to strangers when that person is a celebrity or someone that could help their career but the moment they're in front of someone real they put their head down and avoid the unknown I read something online that said when you see somebody reading a book that you've read the book can recommend you to a person because you initially have something in common with them when you think of something or think of something creatively it might not be creativity because the thought stems from a bunch of subconscious teachings you have or limitations you have ideas you already have on the world preconceived notions biases Etc like if you're going to draw a straight line why are you drawing a straight line are you drawing a straight line because you're full that all the Lin will you to be straight or are you drawing a straight line because out of the glowing of your mind you came up with a straight line obsession is not a dirty word obsession is necessary if you want to attain Mastery desire is not enough passion is not enough you need to let one thing take you over completely right now cuz that's what it takes people are going to call you weird they're going to call you crazy it's okay you will see things that they could only dream of are you ready for this
