      "content": "I just finished helping a 200-bed hospital move their patient management system to AWS. The system was built in 2003, ran on Windows Server 2012, and processed 50,000 patient records daily. The CTO's brief was simple: 'Get us to the cloud without getting us sued.' Three months later, they're running fully compliant in AWS with 60% lower infrastructure costs. Here's how we did it."

Most organizations get paralyzed by the complexity and stay stuck on expensive legacy infrastructure. But the risk of staying put is getting worse than the risk of moving."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The three biggest failure modes I see are compliance panic, technical debt explosion, and vendor lock-in blindness. Organizations either get so worried about HIPAA violations they never make progress, or they ignore compliance until audit time and scramble to retrofit security. Both approaches fail."

      "content": "The technical debt problem is worse in healthcare than anywhere else. I've seen EMR systems running on .NET 2.0 with hardcoded database connections and zero documentation. These systems work, but they're architectural nightmares. You can't just lift-and-shift your way out of 20 years of technical debt."

We use what I call the 'compliance boundary' pattern—separate your PHI-handling services into isolated network segments with dedicated encryption keys and audit streams.
