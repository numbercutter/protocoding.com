      "content": "I've watched real estate appraisers spend two hours filling out reports that AI can now complete in minutes. The property valuation industry is experiencing its biggest transformation since the MLS went digital. Machine learning isn't just speeding up existing processes - it's fundamentally changing how we understand property value."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The numbers tell the story. Traditional appraisals take 7-10 days and cost $300-500. AI-powered valuations happen instantly and cost under $10. But speed and cost aren't the only advantages. Machine learning models can analyze thousands of variables that human appraisers might miss, from satellite imagery changes to hyperlocal market trends."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The data layer pulls from multiple sources: MLS records, public records, satellite imagery, street view data, demographic information, and economic indicators. We're not just looking at comparable sales anymore. Modern systems analyze everything from school district performance to planned infrastructure projects."

      "content": "The modeling approach varies by use case. Automated valuation models (AVMs) for lending might prioritize consistency and regulatory compliance. Investment platforms need models that can identify undervalued properties with high confidence intervals. Each requires different architectures and training strategies."
