      "content": "I've watched dozens of enterprise AI projects fail in the past two years. Not because the models were wrong or the data was bad, but because the underlying systems couldn't handle what AI actually demands. Companies spend millions on data science teams and cutting-edge models, then try to plug them into architectures built for a different era. It's like trying to run a Tesla's software on a 1995 Honda Civic."

      "content": "The numbers tell the story. A recent study by MIT found that 73% of enterprise AI projects never make it to production. Of those that do, 60% are abandoned within 18 months. The culprit isn't AI complexity—it's technical debt. Legacy systems that worked fine for traditional software become massive bottlenecks when you add real-time inference, continuous model updates, and the data pipelines that AI systems need to survive."

      "content": "Most enterprise systems were designed for predictable, batch-oriented workflows. You build features, deploy them quarterly, and they run the same way for months. AI systems are fundamentally different. They need continuous data feeds, real-time inference endpoints, model versioning, A/B testing infrastructure, and the ability to rollback when models drift. Your monolithic application with a single database and annual deployment cycles can't handle this."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The mismatch shows up immediately when teams try to integrate their first AI model. They build a beautiful recommendation engine in Python, then discover their core application is a .NET monolith that takes 6 weeks to deploy changes. They need real-time user behavior data, but it's locked in a data warehouse that updates nightly. They want to A/B test model performance, but the application has no feature flagging system. Each integration point becomes a month-long engineering project."

      "content": "I worked with a retail client who spent $2M on a personalization system. The models were excellent—lift in conversion rates was 23% in testing. But their e-commerce platform was built on a legacy system that couldn't handle real-time API calls without affecting page load times. Users would click 'Add to Cart' and wait 8 seconds while the recommendation engine processed. The project was shelved after 3 months of trying to optimize around architectural constraints that couldn't be fixed."

      "content": "AI models are only as good as their data, but enterprise data is scattered across dozens of systems. Customer data lives in Salesforce, transaction data is in the ERP, behavioral data is in Google Analytics, and operational data is in various departmental databases. Traditional ETL processes that sync this data nightly worked fine for reporting dashboards. They're completely inadequate for AI systems that need fresh, consistent data to make accurate predictions."

Your inventory optimization model needs current stock levels, but the warehouse management system has a 2-day lag in reporting. Your customer service AI needs conversation history, but it's spread across email, chat, and phone systems with different schemas and update schedules. Building the infrastructure to unify and stream this data often costs more than the AI project itself."

      "content": "One financial services client wanted to implement real-time risk scoring. Their loan application process touched 11 different systems—credit bureaus, income verification, fraud databases, regulatory compliance tools. Each system had its own API rate limits, data formats, and availability windows. What should have been a 6-month project to build the AI model turned into an 18-month infrastructure overhaul just to get clean, timely data flowing to the model. The business case evaporated in the delay."

Change management boards, extensive testing cycles, and deployment windows that happen monthly or quarterly. AI systems need the opposite—continuous deployment, rapid iteration, and the ability to update models without touching application code. Your data scientists can't wait 6 weeks to test a model improvement, and your AI systems can't afford to use models that are months out of date."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The deployment mismatch kills AI projects in two ways. First, models become stale before they ever reach production. A demand forecasting model trained on Q1 data doesn't work well when it finally deploys in Q3. Second, the feedback loop between model performance and improvement gets broken. Data scientists need to see how models perform with real data, iterate quickly, and deploy fixes. Enterprise deployment processes make this impossible."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "I've seen teams build sophisticated MLOps platforms just to work around legacy deployment constraints. They containerize models, build separate inference services, and create shadow deployments that sync with production systems. It works, but you've essentially built a parallel technology stack just to serve AI models. The operational complexity and cost often outweigh the benefits of the AI system itself."

AI systems need different metrics—model accuracy, prediction drift, data quality, and business impact. Your existing monitoring tools can tell you if the recommendation API is responding in 200ms, but they can't tell you if the recommendations are getting worse because the underlying data has shifted."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The monitoring gap is dangerous because AI failures are often silent. A traditional application either works or throws an error. An AI model can quietly degrade, producing plausible but wrong results for weeks before anyone notices. Without proper observability, teams don't discover problems until customers complain or business metrics decline. By then, the damage is done and the trust in AI systems is broken."

You need data quality checks at ingestion, model performance tracking in real-time, business metric correlation, and alerting systems that understand the difference between normal variation and concerning drift. Most enterprises don't have this infrastructure, and building it is often more complex than the AI project itself."
