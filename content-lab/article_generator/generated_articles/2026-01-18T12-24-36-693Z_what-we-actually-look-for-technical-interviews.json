      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Here's the thing: most technical interviews optimize for the wrong signals. We're testing performance under artificial pressure instead of the skills that actually matter day-to-day. After hundreds of interviews and years of watching who thrives on engineering teams, I've learned what to actually look for."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "During interviews, I care less about the solution and more about the explanation. Can they walk me through their reasoning? Do they check if I'm following along? When they make assumptions, do they state them out loud?"

      "content": "Last month, a candidate was solving a caching problem. Mid-way through, they said, 'Actually, let me step back. I'm assuming we need to optimize for read speed, but what if writes are more important here?' That self-correction and clarification? That's the stuff."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
