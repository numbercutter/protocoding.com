      "content": "A major credit card company we worked with last year was losing $2.3 million monthly to fraudulent transactions. Their fraud detection system flagged legitimate purchases 40% of the time, creating a customer service nightmare. Today, they catch 94% of fraud attempts with a 3% false positive rate. The difference? AI agents that learn from every transaction in real-time."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Financial services is where AI agents make the most sense. The industry runs on patterns, exceptions, and instant decisions. Human analysts can't process thousands of transactions per second or monitor compliance across 50 different regulations simultaneously. But AI agents can."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Traditional fraud detection relied on static rules. If a transaction exceeded $5,000 or came from a foreign country, flag it. These systems caught obvious fraud but missed sophisticated attacks and annoyed customers with false positives."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Modern AI agents analyze hundreds of variables simultaneously. They consider transaction amount, location, time, merchant type, user behavior patterns, device fingerprints, and network analysis. More importantly, they adapt. When fraudsters change tactics, the agents learn new patterns within hours, not months."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The technical architecture matters here. These agents need sub-100ms response times to approve or deny transactions. That means edge deployment, optimized models, and careful feature engineering. We've seen teams struggle with this because they treat fraud detection like a batch processing problem instead of a real-time streaming challenge."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "AI agents excel here because they can access complete customer histories instantly. They know your transaction patterns, account status, recent interactions, and relevant policies. A good agent can resolve 70% of inquiries without human handoff. The remaining 30% get escalated with full context, making human agents more effective too."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "But there's a catch. These agents need access to core banking systems, customer databases, and external services. The integration work is complex. Most banks have 20+ systems that don't talk to each other well. Building agents that can orchestrate across this mess requires serious engineering effort."
