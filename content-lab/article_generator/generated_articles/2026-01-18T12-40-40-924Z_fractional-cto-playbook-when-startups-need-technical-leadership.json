      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Stage 2 ($100K to $1M ARR): This is where things get interesting. You've got some product-market fit, but your codebase is starting to creak. You're hiring your first developers. You need someone who can make architectural decisions while keeping velocity high."

      "type": "paragraph",

Their API was timing out under load, their database was a mess, and they were losing deals because features took forever to ship. Six months with fractional CTO guidance got them back on track. They're now at $800K ARR with a development process that actually works."
