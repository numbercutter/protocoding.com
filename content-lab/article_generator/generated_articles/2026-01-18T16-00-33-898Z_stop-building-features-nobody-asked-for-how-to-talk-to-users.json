      "content": "Your team just spent four months building a feature that nobody uses. The analytics show 3% adoption after two weeks, and your support tickets haven't decreased. Sound familiar? You're not alone. I've watched dozens of engineering teams burn through runway building elaborate solutions to problems that don't exist. The worst part? It's completely avoidable."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The pattern is always the same. Someone has a brilliant idea in a meeting. The team gets excited. You spend weeks architecting the perfect solution. You launch with fanfare, then... crickets. Meanwhile, your actual users are struggling with basic workflows you could fix in a day. The real kicker? They've been telling you about these problems all along. You just weren't listening."

      "content": "Here's what actually happens when you build without talking to users first. Your team makes assumptions based on their own workflow. They solve edge cases that affect 2% of users while ignoring pain points that hit everyone. They add complexity where users want simplicity. By the time you realize the feature missed the mark, you've burned cash, time, and team morale."

      "content": "I worked with a SaaS company that spent eight months building an advanced reporting dashboard. Beautiful charts, custom filters, real-time updates. Their users ignored it completely. Know what they actually wanted? A simple CSV export button. That's it. One button that took two hours to implement would have solved more problems than eight months of complex engineering."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The math is brutal when you break it down. Four engineers at $150K each, plus overhead, means you're burning roughly $50K per month. A six-month feature that nobody uses just cost you $300K. That's not including opportunity cost of what you could have built instead. Most startups can't afford to get this wrong more than once or twice."

They schedule user interviews and ask leading questions that confirm their biases. They look at analytics dashboards but don't understand the story behind the numbers. This isn't user research, it's validation theater."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Real user research starts with admitting you don't know what users actually need. It means asking open-ended questions and shutting up long enough to hear the answers. It means watching how people actually use your product, not how you think they should use it. Most importantly, it means being willing to kill your favorite ideas when the data says they're wrong."

The best insights come from stories, not survey responses. When they say something is 'fine,' dig deeper. Fine usually means 'I've given up trying to make this work better.' That's where you find the real problems."

Set up proper analytics to see where users drop off, what features they avoid, and where they spend the most time struggling. But combine this with context from conversations. The numbers tell you what's happening, but only users can tell you why."

If users are struggling with data export, don't build a custom reporting engine. Add a CSV download button and see if that solves 80% of the problem. You can always make it fancier later if there's demand."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "This is where most teams mess up. They identify the right problem but over-engineer the solution. Simple fixes feel too easy, so they add complexity that nobody asked for. The goal isn't to impress other developers. It's to make users' lives easier. Sometimes that means a boring solution that works better than a clever one that doesn't."

Are they using other parts of your product more because this friction is gone? These are the metrics that matter. If a simple fix moves the needle, you've found something worth expanding on."

    {

      "content": "Get your whole team talking to users, not just product managers. When engineers hear problems directly from users, they build better solutions. When designers see users struggle with their interfaces, they simplify faster. When executives hear customer pain points firsthand, they prioritize differently. User empathy can't be delegated."

Just because you can build something doesn't mean you should. Your job isn't to ship features. It's to solve problems that people will pay you to solve. Everything else is just expensive distraction."
