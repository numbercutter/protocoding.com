      "content": "Last month, we worked with a client whose Shopify Plus site crashed during their Black Friday launch. They'd hit Shopify's script tag limit, their checkout flow couldn't handle custom B2B pricing logic, and their mobile app needed commerce data that Shopify's APIs couldn't deliver fast enough. The result? $2.3 million in lost revenue over four hours."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "First, performance. Shopify's script tags add overhead to every page load. We've seen enterprise sites with 15+ tracking scripts, custom pricing calculators, and third-party integrations that push page load times past 4 seconds. Google's Core Web Vitals don't care that Shopify's 'fast enough' for most stores."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Second, checkout customization. Need multi-step B2B approval workflows? Custom payment terms? Integration with your ERP's credit system? Shopify Plus gives you some flexibility, but you're still working within their checkout framework. That framework assumes B2C transactions with simple pricing."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Third, data ownership. Every customer interaction, every behavioral event, every conversion happens inside Shopify's system. You can export data, but you can't control the collection granularity or build real-time personalization without round-tripping through their APIs."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The breaking point usually comes when you need to integrate deeply with existing systems. If your commerce experience needs to pull from multiple data sources, apply complex business logic, or deliver sub-100ms API responses, Shopify's architecture becomes a bottleneck."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Headless commerce sounds more complicated than it is. You're just splitting your commerce system into two parts: the backend that handles products, orders, and payments, and the frontend that customers interact with."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Instead of Shopify rendering your store pages, you build custom frontends (web, mobile, kiosks, whatever) that talk to commerce APIs. Your backend becomes a service layer that multiple touchpoints can consume."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "This split gives you complete control over the customer experience. Want to A/B test checkout flows? Build them yourself. Need real-time inventory across 12 warehouse locations? Query your systems directly. Want to launch on TikTok Shop, Amazon, and your mobile app simultaneously? One backend serves them all."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "But headless isn't just about flexibility. It's about performance. We typically see 40-60% improvements in page load speeds when moving from Shopify themes to custom React frontends. That translates directly to conversion rates."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "For backends, you've got options. Shopify's Storefront API can work if you're just trying to escape theme limitations. But if you need more control, platforms like Medusa, Saleor, or CommerceTools give you the commerce primitives without the frontend constraints."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Frontend choices depend on your team's skills and performance requirements. Next.js with TypeScript is our default for most projects. It gives you server-side rendering for SEO, static generation for speed, and enough flexibility to build anything. For mobile, React Native lets you share logic between web and native apps."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The real complexity isn't in the frameworks. It's in the integration layer. You'll need to handle inventory sync, order management, payment processing, and customer data across multiple systems. This is where most headless projects get messy."

      "content": "Phase the migration by traffic segments. Start with organic search traffic, then direct traffic, then paid campaigns. This approach limits blast radius if issues arise. You can always redirect traffic back to Shopify while you fix problems."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The biggest gotcha is usually search indexing. Google treats your new headless site as completely different from your Shopify store. Plan your redirects carefully, implement proper structured data, and monitor search rankings closely for the first few months."

      "content": "Headless isn't always the answer. If you're doing less than $10M annually, Shopify's limitations probably aren't your bottleneck. Your conversion problems are more likely related to product-market fit, pricing, or marketing than platform constraints."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Small teams should think twice. Headless commerce requires frontend developers, backend engineers, DevOps skills, and ongoing maintenance. Shopify's appeal is that one person can run an entire store. Headless commerce needs a team."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Simple product catalogs don't need custom architecture. If you're selling 50 SKUs with straightforward pricing, Shopify's built-in features probably cover 90% of what you need. The remaining 10% might not justify the engineering investment."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "But if you're integrating with existing enterprise systems, need sub-second API responses, or want to own your entire customer data pipeline, headless starts making financial sense. The key is being honest about your actual constraints, not just theoretical ones."
