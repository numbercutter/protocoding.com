    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "MedFlow came to us with a simple problem: patients were drowning in paperwork, and clinics were drowning in administrative overhead. Their vision was a smart patient portal that could intelligently route forms, extract key information, and integrate seamlessly with existing EHR systems. The catch? They needed to be live before their seed funding ran out."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The first week was all about making the right technical bets. We had three major decisions to make: cloud infrastructure, data architecture, and integration strategy. Each one could make or break the timeline."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "For infrastructure, we went with AWS ECS on Fargate. Not the sexiest choice, but it meant we could deploy fast and scale later without rewriting everything. The team was already familiar with Docker, so we weren't introducing new complexity."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Data architecture was trickier. Healthcare data is messy, and HIPAA compliance isn't optional. We built around PostgreSQL with encrypted columns for PHI, plus Redis for session management. Simple, proven, compliant."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "But the real decision was integration strategy. Most healthcare APIs are terrible. We could spend months fighting with EHR vendors, or we could start with file-based imports and build API integrations later. We chose files. Not glamorous, but it got us to market."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "We used a combination of document AI and fine-tuned language models. Google's Document AI handled the OCR and basic extraction. Then we built a custom pipeline using OpenAI's API to normalize and categorize the extracted data."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The key insight: we didn't try to be 100% accurate out of the gate. Instead, we built a confidence scoring system. High-confidence extractions got auto-filled. Medium confidence got flagged for review. Low confidence got skipped entirely."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "This taught us something important: in healthcare, \"real-time\" often means \"faster than manual processes,\" not \"instantaneous.\" Going from 3-day form processing to 24-hour processing was still a massive win for the clinic."

      "content": "Looking back, several factors made this timeline achievable. First, we made technology choices based on speed to market, not theoretical scalability. PostgreSQL instead of fancy NoSQL. REST APIs instead of GraphQL. Boring tech that works."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Second, we embraced good enough. The AI didn't have to be perfect. The integrations didn't have to be real-time. The UI didn't have to be pixel-perfect. It just had to solve the core problem better than the status quo."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Patient satisfaction scores improved significantly. Average form completion time dropped from 23 minutes to 8 minutes. Clinic staff reported saving 4 hours per day on administrative tasks."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "More importantly, MedFlow had a working product to show investors and potential customers. They closed their seed round two months later and are now working on expanding to 5 additional clinics."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "For AI components specifically, confidence scoring is more important than accuracy. Users can handle \"I'm not sure about this field\" better than they can handle confident wrong answers."
