You can't build intelligent recommendations on a foundation of scattered spreadsheets and API calls that take 30 seconds to return customer history."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "But most e-commerce data pipelines look like this: Events get logged to files, files get processed overnight, summaries get dumped into a data warehouse, then someone runs a weekly report. By the time your AI model sees that a customer abandoned their cart, they've already bought from a competitor."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "But the cost of not having proper infrastructure is higher. Batch-processed recommendations lose 60% of their value compared to real-time ones. Inventory optimization based on stale data leads to stockouts and overstock. Customer service AI that can't access recent interactions frustrates more than it helps."
