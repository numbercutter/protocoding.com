      "content": "Technical debt operates like a shadow tax on everything your engineering team touches. You can't see it on any balance sheet, but it's there in every sprint planning meeting that runs long, every bug that takes three times longer to fix than expected, every talented engineer who leaves because they're tired of working around problems instead of solving them."

      "content": "I've watched teams where a single architectural decision from 18 months ago now consumes 40% of their engineering capacity. Not because the original choice was catastrophically wrong, but because they never paid down the principal. Every feature built on top of that foundation inherited its constraints. Every new engineer had to learn its quirks. Every bug fix became an exercise in archaeology."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The math is brutal. If a shortcut saves you two weeks today but adds 30 minutes to every future task that touches that system, you break even after about 40 tasks. After that, you're paying interest forever."

      "content": "Good engineers have options. They can smell technical debt in interviews. When your senior developers spend their time explaining why things work the way they do instead of building new capabilities, word gets out. Your hiring pipeline starts selecting for people who either don't recognize quality issues or don't care about them."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "I've seen this pattern play out dozens of times. The best engineers leave first because they have the most opportunities. The ones who stay become either cynical or institutionalized. New hires get onboarded into accepting suboptimal patterns as 'just how we do things here.' Your team's standards drift downward."
