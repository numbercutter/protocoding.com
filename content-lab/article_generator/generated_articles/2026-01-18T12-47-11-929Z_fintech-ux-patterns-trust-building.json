It's about earning trust when real money is on the line."

      "content": "I've watched teams spend months perfecting onboarding flows, only to see users bail at the first confusing transaction screen. The difference between fintech and other apps isn't just regulatory compliance. It's that your users are scared. They're handing you their most sensitive data and trusting you with their financial future. Your interface design either builds that trust or destroys it."

      "content": "Most UX design starts with user goals and friction points. Fintech design has to start with user fears. What keeps your users awake at night? Identity theft. Overdraft fees. Hidden charges. Losing money to a glitch. Your interface needs to address these anxieties before it tries to be clever or innovative."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "We built a payment app where the original design buried transaction confirmations in a slide-up modal. Clean. Modern. Totally wrong. Users couldn't shake the feeling they'd accidentally sent $500 to the wrong person. We changed it to a full-screen confirmation with giant text showing exactly who gets how much money. Conversions went up 40%. Sometimes anxiety trumps aesthetics."

Interest rates, fees, percentages, compound returns. Your users are making decisions about numbers they don't fully understand."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Real transparency isn't showing everything. It's showing the right things at the right time. Users need to know the total cost before they commit. They don't need to see 47 different fee scenarios upfront. They need to understand what happens to their money. They don't need the full regulatory filing."

Same information, better hierarchy."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Most apps bury customer support behind chatbots and FAQ pages. Financial apps need prominent, immediate access to human help. When someone thinks they've lost $500, they don't want to troubleshoot with a bot. They want to talk to a person who can fix it."
