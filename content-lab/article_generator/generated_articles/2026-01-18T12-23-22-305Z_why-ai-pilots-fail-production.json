      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "**1. No production owner.** The data science team built it, but they don't run production systems. The DevOps team can deploy it, but they don't understand the model. Nobody wants to be on-call for something they can't debug."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "**2. Data pipeline fantasy.** Your pilot used a clean CSV file. Production needs real-time data from three different systems, two of which are down 10% of the time. The data engineering work is 3x bigger than the ML work."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "**3. Accuracy theater.** 94% accuracy sounds impressive until you realize what happens with the 6% of cases the model gets wrong. If those failures aren't graceful, your users will lose trust fast."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "**4. Integration complexity.** Your pilot was a standalone app. Production means integrating with existing workflows, user permissions, audit trails, and compliance requirements. It's not just an API call anymore."
