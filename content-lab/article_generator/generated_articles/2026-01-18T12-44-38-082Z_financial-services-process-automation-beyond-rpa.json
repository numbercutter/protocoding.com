      "content": "Last month, a mid-sized bank called us because their RPA system had been down for three weeks. The culprit? Their core banking system updated a form field name from 'Customer_ID' to 'Client_ID'. That single word change broke 47 automated processes and cost them $2.3 million in manual processing overhead."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "This isn't unusual. We've seen RPA systems fail because a button moved two pixels, a dropdown menu added an option, or a vendor changed their API response format slightly. Traditional robotic process automation treats software like a factory assembly line, but business processes aren't that predictable."

      "content": "Financial services companies invested heavily in RPA between 2018-2022. The promise was simple: automate repetitive tasks, reduce errors, cut costs. And it worked, until it didn't. Now most banks are sitting on dozens of brittle automation scripts that require constant maintenance."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Here's what actually happens. A bank automates their account opening process. The RPA bot can fill forms, move data between systems, and trigger approvals. Everything runs smoothly for six months. Then compliance updates require two additional fields. The bot breaks. IT takes three weeks to fix it because the original developer left and nobody documented the logic properly."

      "content": "We analyzed automation reliability across 12 financial institutions last year. Traditional RPA systems averaged 23 hours of downtime per month due to interface changes, system updates, and edge cases the original scripts couldn't handle. That's nearly 6% downtime for something that's supposed to run 24/7."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "An intelligent workflow understands invoices conceptually. It can identify vendor names, line items, and totals regardless of format. When it encounters a new layout, it adapts. When regulations require additional data extraction, you configure new requirements instead of rewriting scripts."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Intelligent workflows front-load the complexity. Higher initial investment, much lower ongoing maintenance. The break-even point is usually 18-24 months, assuming your processes change regularly. If your business is completely static, stick with RPA. If you're a financial services company dealing with regulatory changes, system updates, and evolving customer expectations, intelligent workflows pay for themselves."
