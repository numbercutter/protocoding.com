They bring in senior talent, stick them in a corner with minimal context, and wonder why velocity drops instead of increases. The problem isn't the engineers. It's how you're integrating them."

      "type": "paragraph",

They bring fresh perspectives without the baggage of 'how we've always done it.' And they can start contributing immediately instead of spending months learning your HR policies."
