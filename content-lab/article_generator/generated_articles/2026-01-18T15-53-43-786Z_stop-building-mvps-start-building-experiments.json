      "content": "Y'all are building MVPs wrong. I've watched dozens of startups spend 6-12 months crafting the \"perfect\" minimum viable product, only to launch it to crickets. They've got beautiful onboarding flows, polished UIs, and features nobody asked for. Meanwhile, their runway is burning and they still don't know if anyone actually wants what they're selling."

      "content": "The MVP concept got hijacked somewhere along the way. What started as Eric Ries's idea of learning through rapid iteration became an excuse to build mini-products with half the features of the \"real\" version. Founders convince themselves they need user authentication, payment processing, and responsive design before they can validate their core hypothesis. That's not an MVP, that's just a smaller product that still takes forever to build."

      "content": "Real MVPs aren't products at all. They're experiments designed to test specific hypotheses about your market, your solution, and your business model. Each experiment should answer one critical question and take no more than two weeks to execute. If you're spending months on your MVP, you're not building an experiment, you're building a product without knowing if there's demand for it."

      "content": "I worked with a healthcare startup that wanted to build an AI-powered diagnostic tool. Their original plan involved 8 months of development, FDA research, and integration with electronic health records. Instead, we convinced them to start with a simple experiment. They created a basic web form where doctors could input symptoms and get back AI-generated suggestions. No user accounts, no fancy interface, just the core value proposition. They had it running in two weeks."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "That experiment taught them three critical things their elaborate MVP never would have. First, doctors were skeptical of AI diagnoses but loved AI-powered research assistance. Second, the real bottleneck wasn't generating suggestions but integrating with existing workflows. Third, the money wasn't in individual doctor subscriptions but in enterprise deals with hospital systems. None of these insights required building a full product."

The businesses couldn't create engaging content consistently. His manual service became a content creation agency, not a scheduling tool."

You can spend months perfecting your authentication system while completely missing the fact that your target market doesn't trust your solution. Code is concrete and measurable. Market validation is messy and uncomfortable. Guess which one most technical founders choose?"
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The build trap gets worse with technical founders because we underestimate how long things take and overestimate what we need to launch. We think about edge cases and security concerns and scalability challenges that don't matter if nobody wants the product. I've seen startups optimize database queries for user loads they'll never reach while ignoring basic usability problems that kill conversion."

By the time they build a real product, they already know it'll work because they've validated every major assumption separately. Their \"MVP\" is actually a confident bet, not a hopeful guess."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "This approach works especially well for AI and data-heavy products where the technology is complex but the core value proposition can be tested simply. You don't need machine learning models to test if people want AI-powered insights. You can generate those insights manually and see if they change behavior. You don't need real-time processing to test if users value speed over accuracy. You can simulate different response times and measure user satisfaction."

Turn that assumption into a testable hypothesis with clear success metrics. Then design the simplest possible experiment to test it. If you can't test your assumption in two weeks or less, break it down further."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Document everything. Not just what worked, but what didn't and why. Failed experiments are as valuable as successful ones if you learn from them. Keep a running list of validated and invalidated assumptions. This becomes your foundation for making product decisions later. When you finally do build something substantial, you'll know exactly what to include and what to leave out."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Most importantly, resist the urge to build when you could test instead. Every time you think \"I need to build X before I can validate Y,\" challenge that assumption. Usually there's a way to test Y without building X. The goal is learning, not shipping. Shipping comes after you know what to ship. This mindset shift alone will save you months of wasted effort and thousands of dollars in development costs."
