Patients downloaded it once and never came back. The problem wasn't the budget or the team. It was that they built a desktop experience crammed into a phone."

      "content": "We built an app for a cardiology practice where 40% of calls were 'Did my lab results come in yet?' The app's core feature became push notifications when results were ready, plus one-tap viewing. Simple, but it cut phone volume in half and patients loved getting answers immediately instead of playing phone tag."
