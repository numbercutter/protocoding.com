      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Total cost: This isn't just subscription fees vs engineering salaries. Factor in maintenance, security updates, compliance, and opportunity cost. That 'free' open source solution often costs 10x more than SaaS once you account for engineering time."

      "type": "paragraph",
