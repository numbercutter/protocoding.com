# Anti-AI Slop Rules

## The Problem

AI-generated content has recognizable patterns that make readers tune out. These rules prevent the "AI voice" from leaking into articles.

---

## BANNED: Punctuation & Formatting

### Em-dashes (—)
❌ "The solution—if there is one—requires rethinking..."
✅ "The solution, if there is one, requires rethinking..."
✅ "The solution requires rethinking. If there is one."

### Excessive semicolons
❌ "We built the feature; users loved it; revenue increased."
✅ "We built the feature. Users loved it. Revenue increased."

### Bullet point addiction
❌ Every section as bullets
✅ Bullets only for actual lists, prose for arguments

### Overuse of colons for emphasis
❌ "Here's the thing: most companies fail."
✅ "Most companies fail."

## REQUIRED: Human Writing Patterns

### Contractions

- Start some sentences with "And" or "But"
- Use fragments occasionally. Like this.

### Specific over vague
❌ "Many companies struggle with this."
✅ "I've talked to 30+ CTOs this year. Most are stuck."

### Numbers over adjectives
❌ "Significantly faster"
✅ "40% faster"

### Stories over statements
❌ "Data quality is often a problem."

### Opinions over hedging

## The Sniff Test

Before publishing, read the article aloud. Ask:

1. **Would a human actually say this?** If it sounds like a press release, rewrite.

2. **Is there a point?** Every paragraph should make ONE clear point.

3. **Where's the author?** If you can't tell who wrote it, the voice is too generic.

4. **Would I share this?** If it's forgettable, it's not ready.

5. **Em-dash count?** If more than 1 per article, you've been AI-slopped.

## Examples

### Before (AI slop):
"In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, organizations must leverage cutting-edge AI solutions to stay competitive. The journey towards digital transformation—while challenging—offers unprecedented opportunities for those willing to embrace change."

### After (Human):
"Most companies know they need AI. They just don't know where to start. We've helped 20+ teams go from 'we should probably do something' to production AI in under 6 months. Here's what actually works."

## Final Rule

**Write like you're explaining to a smart friend over coffee, not like you're writing a LinkedIn post.**
