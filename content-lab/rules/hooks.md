1. Clarity
   Can a 10-year-old instantly understand the hook?
   No jargon, fluff, or confusing phrasing.
2. Specificity
   Does it include a specific detail, number, or result (instead of being vague)?
   Would someone immediately know what they’ll get if they keep watching?
3. Emotion
   Does the hook use emotionally charged keywords (e.g., shocking, secret, mistake, hidden, fastest, proven)?
   Does it spark curiosity, urgency, or FOMO?
4. Alignment
   Does the hook match the content of the video (no clickbait that breaks trust)?
   Is the value promised in the hook delivered quickly in the video?
5. Novelty (Purple Cow Effect)
   Does it stand out with something unique, surprising, or fresh for your niche?
   Would it grab attention even without sound (on-screen text/visuals)?
6. Retention Power
   Can it be delivered in under 3 seconds?
   Does it make viewers think: “I need to see what happens next”?
