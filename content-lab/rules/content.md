📌 TL;DR
To create viral hooks that capture attention within the first 3 seconds, copy viral hooks, understand why they work, and maximize them with specific, emotionally resonant keywords while maintaining consistency in posting.

🎯 Main Arguments
[Hooks are Crucial]: The first 3-5 seconds of your video determine its success; if you don't capture attention immediately, the rest of the video doesn't matter. 00:00

[Understanding the "Why"]: It's not enough to copy; you must understand why a hook went viral by identifying the keywords that trigger emotion in viewers. 10:13
