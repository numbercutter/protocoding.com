🎯 1. Strategy Level → Spread Across Content Pieces
Your overall strategy should aim to hit all 5 awareness levels across your short-form content library.
Think of it like a portfolio:
Some videos = Unaware/Problem aware (broad, scroll-stopping, entertaining).
Some = Solution aware (educational, “how to fix X”).
Some = Product aware / Most aware (testimonial clips, direct CTAs).
Not every piece needs to do everything — instead, each one plays a role in moving people through the pipeline.

🎯 2. Single Content Piece → Usually Focus on ONE Stage
A 30–60 sec short typically works best if it speaks to ONE awareness stage clearly.
Example:
Hook: “Tired of your phone always dying at 30%?” → Problem aware.
Main: “Here’s why most chargers don’t last…” → bridging into Solution aware.
If you try to cover all 5 stages in one clip, it usually feels rushed, confusing, or too “salesy.”
⚡ BUT… Mini-Funnels Exist in a Single Piece

Sometimes a strong short can flow like a micro journey:
Hook → Agitate problem (Problem aware)
Educate briefly (Solution aware)
Soft pitch / CTA (Product aware / Most aware)
👉 This works well in direct response style content (like TikTok UGC ads or hard-selling Reels).
✅ Best practice for organic short-form:
80% of your videos should live in the Unaware → Problem aware → Solution aware zones (attention + education).
20% should live in the Product aware → Most aware zones (conversion-focused).
That way, new people keep discovering you, and the warmed-up ones keep getting nudged toward buying.
